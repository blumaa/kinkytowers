export const moonPoem = `Look at her up in the sky, sitting \nthere, naturally, in her moon chamber, \norbiting, typing away at her cosmic typewriter. \n\nWatch as her fingers dance \nacross the keys as if she were a pianist \nplaying a moonlit sonata. As she pauses \nto think, she draws in a breath, pulling \nfrom a pipe branching from her \nlips, the bowl packed to the brim \nwith kismet, with hot coals \nof stardust glowing red \nlike young stars. \n\nShe lets smoke escape her lips, \na shroud of clouds dances \naround her like the rings of Saturn. \n\nThwack thwack go the keys. Ding goes the bell \nas the carriage runs out at the end \nof each tide. She logs all the events \nof history, as usual, all the stories \nof time. She has both witnessed all of it \nand been a part of it all. She writes \nin her cosmic journal: tales \nof evolution, excitement, genocide, \nsorrow; she has seen the most terrible \nthings and the most beautiful \nthings. Is there any difference? she asks \nherself as she pulls back \nthe carriage and lets the tide flow \nout. Her mind empties \n\nand begins to fill up again- pooling \nand swirling in the great cosmic bird bath- \nher fingers type the tide in, smooching the sand just a little \n\nmore every minute. The blood red \nclouds begin to drip, the mountains echo \nwith howls. A lonely fool, bumbles along \ninnocently, stumbles across the stones \nat the base of a tower. A very high \npriestess performs magical rituals \nat the top of the very same tower.`;
